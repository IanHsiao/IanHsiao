Hi, I’m @IanHsiao

I am an experienced RD manager, as well as a hands-on designer and engineer strong in MEMS and multi-disciplinary tasks. 

With a can-do spirit and proactive attitude, I enjoy learning new things and make good use of them. Learning software coding is just one of them.

I am still a beginner on many fields, however, I deeply believe that the dots will connect eventually. For instance, I came up this AOI product that consists of RPi, DIO PCB, opencv and the C++ program for industrial application.

Been there. Done that!   Looking forward to seeing opportunities to collect more dots and to connect them is fancy ways.
